# sequelize-commerce-w13 ![licenseBadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
## Description

I have been tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I will also use environment variables to store sensitive data, like username, password and database name.

## Development

This project wasn't so much of a struggle - once I had the code functioning a lot of was possible to be re-used in other files. I did struggle in the process of publishing the app as I was unfamiliar with Insomnina and there were minor errors that was preventing me from running successfully. Most of the error codes I recieved were capable of pointing me toward my mistake but in some instances it was vague and unclear (i.e. an error message that told me id's were being replicated was due to faulty coding pertaining to a blank space after writing belongsToMany) and while I was able to follow a line of logic to the mistake it took a while. I wonder if I can make errors appear clearer.
